#### What was your role / which stories did you work on
I worked on both frontend and backend. I set up the basic layout of [Login page](https://github.com/jVtec1/cst438_project1/issues/2), also giving it basic restrictions. I completed the [search page dropdown functionality](https://github.com/jVtec1/cst438_project1/issues/9) with the API call filling the dropdown menus. I also set up the [checkout/my cart page](https://github.com/jVtec1/cst438_project1/issues/8) functionality and layout by creating a contexts folder and context file for cart functionality, covering [issue #14](https://github.com/jVtec1/cst438_project1/issues/14) and [issue #16](https://github.com/jVtec1/cst438_project1/issues/16). I created a [unit test](https://github.com/jVtec1/cst438_project1/issues/35) for the my cart page and styled both the search and my cart page. I also added a [confirm purchase](https://github.com/jVtec1/cst438_project1/issues/33) button to the checkout page. 

+ What was the biggest challenge?

  The biggest challenge was downloading the dependencies and setting up an unit test. 
+ Why was it a challenge?

  My project broke as I was downloading different dependencies, thinking it would get a step closer in troubleshooting to set up correct tests. 
  + How was the challenge addressed?

    My teammate was able to figure out what dependencies exactly to download and how to set up the test. With his help, I followed his testing format to create a unit test for one of the pages I was working on. 
+ Favorite / most interesting part of this project

  My favorite part of this project was realizing how much easier it was to do things in React Native than in Android Studio. 
+ If you could do it over, what would you change?

  As far as pacing went while doing the project, it felt like my team and I were on the right track. The only thing I would change is if I am going to try to do something that might break the project: changing folder names, downloading dependencies for unit tests, I would create a different branch to do it on, so I can just ignore it if everything goes bad. 
+ What is the most valuable thing you learned?

Time management and also make good comments, so my teammates understand what is happening in the file.

## Conclusion

- How successful was the project?
  - Think in terms of what did you set out to do and what actually got done?
    
    Our project was successful in the fact that we got the minimum requirements for it, including: displaying information from an API and having a logged-in user's information display.
    We wanted to do a lot more with our project, but we got the basic functionality of allowing a user to create an account and sign in, search for vehicles, and add and remove vehicles in cart. We also styled our app. 
- What was the largest victory?

    Getting difficult things to work, such as getting the database up and running, and figuring out how to get our API to work in the app in addition to connecting two code files that made those API calls. Completing the search page felt very good because it felt like our app was really coming together. 
- Final assessment of the project

  This was a good first project to learn React Native and Expo, and to practice putting together a frontend and backend of an application from scratch.
